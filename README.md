# Sign Up Form

https://jason-lava.github.io/sign-up-form/

User sign up form. Required to add all form inputs: 
* First name
* Last name
* Email address
* Telephone number
* Password

# How It's Made
Tech used: 99% is HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript

I added all container, text, and form inputs in the HTML and used CSS to style every bit of them to make a cohesive and nice layout that's intuitive for a User to sign up for pizza updates.

# Lessons Learned

I learned how to add form inputs, how to require a User to add data, how to style the input boxes for valid or invalid responses. Overall a nice fun project that will prove useful.
